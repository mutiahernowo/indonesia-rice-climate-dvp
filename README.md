# Climate Change and Rice Productivity in Indonesia (2014-2019)

This is an interactive data visualisation project that is exploring the relationship between climate change and rice production across 10 provinces Indonesia from 2019 to 2024.
These 10 provinces are the largest rice producting provinces in Indonesia based on Tempo (https://en.tempo.co/read/1514650/the-10-largest-rice-producing-provinces-in-indonesia).

The website was developed as a final project for Data Exploration and Visualisation unit during my master's degree in Monash University, Australia and presented as part of my data visualisation portofolio.

==============================================================

## Project Overview
Climate change has increasingly impacted agricultural productivity, especially rice production which is a staple food for Indonesian.
This project aims to help users explore how climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity relate to rice productivity across different provinces and over time.
The visualisation is designed to support exploratory analysis for students, researchers, and policymakers.

Before I developed the visualisation into an interactive website, I have done an exploration including climate data aggregation to get the final data.

## Key Features

- Interactive choropleth map of Indonesian provinces  
- Exploration throughout years (2019-2024)
- Climate variables visualised alongside rice productivity  
- Scrollytelling layout to guide user exploration  
- Responsive web-based implementation

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- D3.js
